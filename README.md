## 🎯 What is Low-Code/No-Code?

Low-Code/No-Code platforms are transforming software development by enabling rapid application creation with minimal or zero traditional programming. These platforms use visual development interfaces, drag-and-drop components, and declarative configurations to democratize software creation.

### 🎨 **Low-Code Platforms**

- Require minimal coding knowledge
- Offer visual development interfaces
- Allow custom code integration
- Target professional developers and power users

### 🖱️ **No-Code Platforms**

- Require zero programming knowledge
- Completely visual/configuration-based
- Pre-built components and templates
- Target business users and citizen developers

### 📈 **Why Low-Code/No-Code?**

```
🚀 10x faster development
💰 80% cost reduction
👥 Bridge the developer shortage
🔧 Rapid prototyping & iteration
📱 Cross-platform deployment
🎯 Focus on business logic, not boilerplate
```
